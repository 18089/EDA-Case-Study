## Conclusions
-  Conclusion 1 : The observation that 60-month term loans have a higher default rate compared to 36-month term loans 
                  aligns with common industry knowledge. Longer loan terms are often associated with increased risk, 
                  as they allow for smaller monthly payments but can result in a higher overall interest cost. This finding 
                  highlights the importance of considering loan term in assessing default risk.

- Conclusion 2 : Noting that verified loans have a higher default rate compared to non-verified and source-verified loans
                 highlights the importance of income verification in the lending process. Loans that are not verified or
                 source-verified might be less risky due to the rigorous income verification process associated with 
                 "Verified" loans.

- Conclusion 3 : Borrowers who take on substantial loans may face more significant financial challenges in repaying them,
                 especially if their business operations or financial stability are uncertain. This can lead to a higher 
                 likelihood of default.
